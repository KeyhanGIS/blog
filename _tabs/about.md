I'm Keyhan Khosravifard, a GIS Engineer (M.Sc.) specializing in Web GIS development with a focus on open-source technologies. I design and implement customized Web GIS solutions using tools like **Python**, **Django**, **PostGIS**, **Leaflet**, **GeoServer**, and **JavaScript** to solve real-world spatial problems in applied and research-based projects.

My portfolio includes designing context-aware recommender systems for tourism, real-time fault monitoring dashboards, and municipal Web GIS platforms. I also provide hands-on training in Web GIS development through practical projects.

Currently based in Iran, I’m open to **remote opportunities**, freelance collaborations, and international engagements where I can contribute to meaningful map-based solutions.
